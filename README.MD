Video Poker V0.2

This is a typical casino video poker game: place a bet, then choose which cards you want to hold, and the game will draw new cards and check if you've won. If you run out of money the game resets.

The graphical interface is click operated; Keyboard functionality has broken sometime since the code was last majorly updated in 2010. This was done back in high school before I learned about clean, maintainable code and design patterns, and is left up to demonstrate that I can build a cohesive application from scratch. 

Launch it by going to the "Video Poker" directory and running:
	$ java engine
